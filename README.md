# YouTube_Video_Classifier
A machine learning based model that categorizes YouTube videos into 6 categories namely Travel, Science, Food, History, Manufacturing, ArtnDance.

This model consists of concepts such as WebScraping, NLP, Supervised Learning.
Having a basic knowledge on above mentioned topics would help you understand it better.

Libraries used are Selenium, Scikit-learn, Webdriver, numpy, pandas etc.

This is an i_python_notebook(ipynb extension file), So install Jupyter.

I have also added how this model works by testing it against a video's data but haven't deployed it in real life.
